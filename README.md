If you're making changes to CSS:

1. Install Node via [website](https://nodejs.org/en/) or Homebrew (`brew install node`)
2. Install Gulp: `npm install -g gulp`
3. Switch to the project directory and run `npm install`
4. Run `gulp` to build CSS

Run `gulp watch` to continually rebuild CSS as you edit.
